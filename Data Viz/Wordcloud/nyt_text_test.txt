Correction: Because of an editing error, a headline on Wednesday's article about a former FBI official at the center of the latest controversy over Hillary Clinton’s private emails referred incorrectly to comments he made about his involvement. While he said he did in fact offer to trade favors with the State Department about an email classification issue last year, he also said that he quickly dropped the offer once he realized it involved the 2012 Benghazi attacks and Mrs. Clinton’s emails. He did not admit to a “quid pro quo” specifically over Mrs. Clinton’s emails. We have edited this Facebook post to update the headline and the share copy.
