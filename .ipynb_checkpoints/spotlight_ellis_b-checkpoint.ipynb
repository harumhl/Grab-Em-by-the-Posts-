    "\n",
    "Pygal is a data visualiation tool that offers interactive plots that can be embedded in to web browsers. What differentiates Pygal from other interactive visualization libraries is the ability to output charts as SVGs. The only downfall to being able to create SVG as an output is if you are using hundreds of thousands of data points, you will have trouble rendering the SVG to be a clear image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pygal Setup\n",
    "1. Install Pygal using \"pip install pygal\"\n",
    "2. To render the charts in the browser you have to install lxml using \"conda install --name cs489 -c anaconda lxml=3.6.4\"\n",

    "### The data\n",
    "I used the dc comic characters from the github five thirty eight files. Since this data set gives distinguishing characteristics for all of the comic characters I wanted to evaluate these with this package library, and eventually try to see if there were key characteristics separating Good Characters from Bad Characters."
