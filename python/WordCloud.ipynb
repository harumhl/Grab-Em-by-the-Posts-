Summer Zervos, a contestant on season five of the reality show, says Donald Trump kissed and grabbed her in a Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow in 2007. Correction: Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, tweeted that Bill DeBlasio is \"a terrorist,\" not Bernie Sanders as previously tweeted. “If Billy had been passive or responded ‘Shut the f**k up’ to Trump, Billy would have been out of a job the next day,” Bush's lawyer said. It was \"really weird,\" Clinton said, when Trump would follow her across the podium and stand behind her. \"I don’t understand the basis of her claim.\"Mike Pence responds to Michelle Obama's critique of Trump:  “What a terrorist,\" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said of Bernie Sanders in one email.

So far, her campaign has only tweeted that the tape is \"horrific\" and Trump can't be president. After a video of Trump making lewd comments went public, prominent Republicans have called upon him to drop out. Bill Clinton was in Milwaukee talking about climate change when Trump-friendly protesters interrupted his event, shouting, “Bill Clinton is a rapist!” Some Republican donors are even asking for Mike Pence to replace Trump at the top of the ticket.

Some are even calling for him to drop out of the 2016 race.

But Trump isn't giving in to criticism.Continuing coverage on CBSN:  “Invariably, they’ll say, this time we got him,\" said Mike Pence. \"Then they turn on the next television the next morning, and Donald Trump is still standing stronger than ever...\" Donald Trump issued a late-night apology in a Facebook video, saying he would be at Sunday's debate, but his apology may not be enough for some GOP leaders. Prominent Republicans condemned the lewd comments Trump made in 2005. \"I never said I’m a perfect person,” Trump said in a Facebook video released just after midnight Saturday. “Nor pretended to be someone that I’m not. I’ve said and done things I regret and the words released today on this more than a decade old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me knows these words don’t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong and I apologize.” Hillary Clinton said she suspected Russia was behind the hackings in early September. The vulgar conversation between the GOP nominee and then-Access Hollywood host Billy Bush was caught on a hot microphone; Trump has dismissed it as \"locker room banter.\" Both Hillary Clinton and Donald J.
